What is ROOTMAP?
===================================

ROOTMAP is a root modelling program that shows the growth of a plant’s root system under varying conditions of soil, rainfall and other weather. (Above-ground growth of a plant is not displayed.) The program is highly configurable. A plant’s environment can be set up with different soil types and qualities (including growing in nutrient solution), growing temperatures, rainfall events and fertiliser regimes. The program also allows the type and growth of the plant to be modified, to replicate the growth styles of wheat, lupin or other field crops and to match and then extrapolate from field observations.
